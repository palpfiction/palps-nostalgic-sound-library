  palp's nostalgic sound library
</h1>

My personal nostalgia library. Developed from scratch with Gatsby 3.

## Develop

```shell
npm run develop
```
and the blog should be running at http://localhost:8080.

You can also run 

```shell
npm run develop-lan
```

so that you can connect not only from your computer but from any device from your LAN (useful for testing in mobile). The url used for this will come out in the terminal.
